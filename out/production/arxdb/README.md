# ARX Database
>***ARX Database*** - a database management system of a new type. Tables in databases are represented by `classes` and `objects`. Manipulation with the contents of the table occurs in stages (from the stage of user selection to the selection of a particular attribute of the object and obtaining its value). At the same time, the system maintains conciseness and regularity in architecture, keeping the workspace clean.

The main ideas of this project are:
```
* Maximum simplification of the system;

* Controllability of the system by a person, regardless of his level of knowledge about the work of databases;

* Providing the easiest and most affordable system for home, work and educational use;
```
